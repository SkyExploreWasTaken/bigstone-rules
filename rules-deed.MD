# Bigstone Rules

1. **Don't act like an asshole**
   * That's the main super important rule. Don't break it.
     * "_What if I do ?_"
   * Don't.
2. The basic rules of the server
   1. Staff words are final. We reserve ourselves all the rights. Don't try to argue over us.
   2. Don't harrass people. It's bad. There are some examples:
      * Mass-mentioning people for any reason;
      * Asking people to do something even if they said no;
      * Annoying people on Minecraft by spamming messages to them;
3. Discord rules

   **WARNING:** _This applies to the Bigstone MC Server category of the Daxis Community Discord Server. This doesn't apply to the rest of the server as it belongs to Daxis himself._
   1. Don't DM staff nor mass-ping them. They are humans.
   2. Don't open multiples bug reports threads. It is useless and will most likely get you time-outed.
   3. Do not harrass everyone, be kind and comprehensive, even if you think someone asks a stupid question. You have the right to ignore it but not to mock at it.

   **Those were the obvious rules. Now let's head to more specific cases:**

4. The public world
   1. Don't grief it. The sign saying "It might be griefed at any moment" might be tempting, but it's not because we aggred to not put restrictions in this world that it is allowed to grief it.
   2. If you make an error with Axiom and/or WorldEdit (it happens even to me), take care to undo your errors. If there's one you can't, you still can contact staff via a bug report thread or else. Don't worry, as long as you repair you won't get banned or else. _**This also applies to shared plots and worlds.**_
5. The plots world
   1. You can get your own plot easily with the command `/ps auto`. Your plot is your own place to build safely. You don't want someone to annoy you right ? Well no one wants. So be like you want others to be with you.
   2. You can invite people to build with you in your plot with some commands. Since not everyone is kind, choose carefully who you invite to your plot.
6. Private worlds
   1. Private worlds are reserved to some people who are really good at redstone. Those some people are determined by staff only, so don't ask for it.
   2. You can use Axiom in your own private world, but people who you invite to your world can't. If you invite people to your world, they will only be able to use World Edit. If you really need someone to help you, you can ask a staff in regular channels or similar.
7. NBT Abusive Items

   I have a very restrictive mindset about this. I won't allow any illegal enchants and/or NBT data. It's for the security of the server.
