# Bigstone Rules

1. **Don't act like an asshole**
   * That's the main super important rule. Don't break it.
     * "_What if I do ?_"
   * Don't.
2. The basic rules of the server
   1. Staff words are final. We reserve ourselves the right to punish anyone if we want. Don't try to argue over them as it could just escalate easily.
   2. Don't harrass people. It's bad. There are already been some people harrassing for example mods and they have been punished as they deserved it. They are some examples:
      * Mass-mentioning staff to get a thing done.
      * Asking people to do something even if they said no.
      * Annoying people on Minecraft by spamming messages to them
3. Discord rules

   **WARNING:** _This applies to the Bigstone MC Server category of the Daxis Community Discord Server. This doesn't apply to the rest of the server as it belongs to Daxis himself._
   1. Don't DM staff nor mass-ping them. They are humans. Don't treat them as robots.
   2. Don't open multiples bug reports threads because we don't immediately see them. It is useless, won't help you and will most likely get you time-outed or banned.
   3. Do not harrass everyone, be kind and comprehensive, even if you think someone asks a stupid question. You have the right to ignore it but not to laugh at it.

   **Those were the obvious rules. Now let's head to more specific cases:**

4. The public world
   1. Don't grief it. The sign saying "It might be griefed at any moment" might be tempting, but it's not because we aggred to not put restrictions in this world that it is allowed to grief it.
   2. Don't build over other people builds. You can make errors with Axiom and WorldEdit (it happens even to me), but take care to undo your errors. If there's one you can't, you still can contact staff via a bug report thread or else. Don't worry, as long as you repair you won't get banned or else. _**This also applies to shared plots and worlds.**_
5. The plots world
   1. You can get your own plot easily with the command `/ps auto`. Your plot is your own place to build safely. You don't want someone to annoy you right ? Well no one wants. So be like you want others to be with you.
   2. You can invite people to build with you in your plot with some commands. Since allowing someone to build also allows him to destroy everything, it's your job to take care of who you invite at your plot.
6. Private worlds
   1. Private worlds are reserved to some people who are really good at redstone. Those some people are determined by staff only, so don't ask for it.
   2. You can use Axiom in your own private world, but people who you invite to your world can't. If you invite people to your world, they will only be able to use World Edit. If you really need someone to help you, you can ask a staff in regular channels or similar.
